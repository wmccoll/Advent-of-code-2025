### Advent of Code 2025

Gonna try and do this relatively on time this year, started late but I'll be happy if I can get at least half of the days done. Will also be keeping notes here on each day

#### Day 1

The first problem (`Day1.py`) was relatively quick, but when attempting to expand my work to encompass the second part of the day's problem, I forgot that counting upwards and downwards from a multiple of 100 would need to be handled differently depending on positive/negative state. I eventually rewrote my algorithm after doing some rubber duck debugging, and ended up with a solution that I'm overall happy with, even if it's not the most concise.
